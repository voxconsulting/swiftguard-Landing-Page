            <h1>Terms of Service and Use</h1>

            <p>
                Welcome to SwiftGuard Responder. Our goal is to help you stay safe by providing instant notifications,
                live broadcasts of reported incidents, and other value-added services to keep you informed. To that end,
                we constantly strive to provide users with tools that enhance their safety and help them avoid unsafe
                situations. We do this by collecting real-time event data from you, our users, public sector sources,
                and other content we collect through our infrastructure. By using our App, you are contributing to our
                mission of making the world a safer place.
            </p>

            <p>
                These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are between you and SwiftGuard Responder, the company that operates the
                SwiftGuard Responder mobile app and website (<a href="https://swiftguard.app">swiftguard.app</a>). These
                Terms govern your access to and use of the SwiftGuard Responder Service(s), which include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The SwiftGuard Responder mobile application ("App")</li>
                <li>Any text, graphics, photos, videos, or other materials that appear on the App (collectively referred
                    to as “Content”)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Basic Terms and Risk Assumption</h2>

            <h3>A. Risks and User Conduct</h3>
            <p>
                You acknowledge that using the Services may involve risks, especially when capturing or interacting with
                emergency situations or incidents. You assume all risks involved in the activities related to the use of
                the Services. SwiftGuard is not responsible for directing or managing how you gather or interact with
                the Content. Any harm or injuries incurred during your use of the Services are solely your
                responsibility, and SwiftGuard shall not be liable for any damages or losses.
            </p>
            <p>
                You represent and warrant that you understand the risks associated with using the Services and will not
                engage in any unsafe, illegal, or dangerous activities while using them.
            </p>

            <h3>B. Eligibility</h3>
            <p>
                You may access and use the Services only if you are at least 18 years old and able to form a binding
                contract with SwiftGuard. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you represent that
                you are authorized to do so.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Changes to Services or Terms</h2>
            <p>
                The Services may change over time, and we may update these Terms as needed. Any changes will be posted
                on the SwiftGuard website and will take effect when posted. If you do not agree to any changes, you
                should stop using the Services. Continued use of the Services after changes are posted constitutes your
                acceptance of the new Terms.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Service Features</h2>
            <p>
                To fully utilize the Services, you must allow the App to access certain functions on your mobile device,

                the functionality of the App. You are responsible for providing the necessary equipment and maintaining
                any internet or mobile connections required to use the App.
            </p>

                of services without any fees.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Account Security</h2>
            <p>
                You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information, including your

                account.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Content Ownership and Rights</h2>
            <p>
                All right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will

                the Services.

                arbitration.
            </p>

            <h2>11. Termination</h2>
            <p>
                SwiftGuard reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time for any
