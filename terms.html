            <h1>Terms of Services and Use</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to SwiftGuard Responder. Our goal is to help you stay safe by providing instant notifications,
                live broadcasts of reported incidents, and other value-added services to keep you informed. To that end,
                we constantly strive to provide users with tools that enhance their safety and help them avoid unsafe
                situations. We do this by collecting content of real-time events from you, our users, individuals with
                relevant content, public sector and news outlet sources, and from content we otherwise collect through
                our infrastructure. As a user of our App (as defined below), you are also helping us in our mission to
                make the world a safer place.
            </p>
            <p>
                These Terms of Use, along with any other supplemental terms that are incorporated by reference or may be
                presented to you for your review and acceptance (collectively, the “Terms”), are between you and
                SwiftGuard Responder, the company that operates the SwiftGuard Responder mobile app and swiftguard.app,
                including its subsidiaries and affiliated entities under common ownership and control, (“SwiftGuard” or
                “Company”). These Terms govern your access to and use of SwiftGuard’s “SwiftGuard Responder” Service(s)
                as may be offered from time to time and as defined in the list below, and as further described in the
                Product Descriptions linked for each Product type listed below, including:
            </p>

                    to as “Content”).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

                THESE TERMS REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY
                TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND ALSO LIMIT THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE. PLEASE
                CAREFULLY REVIEW SECTION 14 (GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION) BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION.

                WHEN USING THE PREMIUM SERVICES, ALL CALLS, VIDEO CALLS, AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS WITH A SWIFTGUARD
                AGENT MAY BE RECORDED AND MONITORED BY SWIFTGUARD FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE, ARCHIVAL PURPOSES, AND

            </p>
            <p>
                THESE TERMS WILL APPLY TO YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO THE SERVICES AND CONTENT. IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO THE

                THE AUTO RENEWAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 7(B) (AUTOMATIC RENEWAL FOR PREMIUM SERVICES) BELOW. ANY
                RENEWAL TERMS SHALL BE BILLED AT SWIFTGUARD’S THEN-CURRENT RATES.
            </p>
            <h2>1. BASIC TERMS AND RISK ASSUMPTION</h2>
            <h3>A. Risks and User Conduct</h3>
            <p>
                YOU HEREBY REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE DULY AWARE THAT THE ACTIVITIES IN WHICH YOU MAY BE PARTICIPATING IN
                CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE SERVICES AND/OR THE CAPTURING OF CONTENT TO BE UPLOADED TO THE SERVICES
                MAY INVOLVE RISKS. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND ASSUME THESE RISKS AND YOU HEREBY ELECT, VOLUNTARILY, TO
                ENGAGE IN SUCH ACTIVITIES.

                YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT: (1) YOU UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
                ACTIVITIES YOU MAY ENGAGE IN; (2) YOU UNDERSTAND THAT (A) YOU SHOULD NOT TRAVEL TO OR REMAIN IN ANY AREA
                DURING, BEFORE, OR AFTER A CRIME OR OTHER HAZARDOUS SITUATION AND (B) SWIFTGUARD HAS NO RIGHT OR ABILITY
                TO DIRECT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU GATHER CONTENT; (3) ANY INJURIES OR OTHER DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU ARE
                INCURRED AT YOUR OWN RISK AND WILL NOT BE COMPENSABLE BY WORKERS COMPENSATION OR ANY OTHER INSURANCE
                PROGRAM MAINTAINED BY SWIFTGUARD, AND SWIFTGUARD SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR OTHERS IN ANY WAY FOR
                SUCH DAMAGES; AND (4) YOU WILL NOT INCITE, ENCOURAGE, CAUSE, OR ENGAGE IN ANY CRIMINAL, HAZARDOUS,
                ILLEGAL, OR OTHERWISE UNSAFE ACTIVITY IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES OR IN AN EFFORT TO
                OBTAIN OR PROVIDE CONTENT.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may access and use the Services and Content only if you are at least 18 years of age and of sound
                mind, you can form a binding contract with SwiftGuard, and you are not a person barred from receiving or
                using the Services under the laws of Sweden, Zambia, or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are
                accepting these Terms and using or accessing the Services and Content on behalf of a company,
                organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do
                so and are binding such legal entity to these terms as an authorized individual. You may use and access
                the Services and Content only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national,
                and international laws, rules, and regulations.
            </p>
            <h3>B. Changes to Services or Terms</h3>
            <p>
                The Services that SwiftGuard provides are always evolving, and the form and nature of the Services may
                change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, SwiftGuard may stop (permanently or
                temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally
                and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. You may need to update third-party software from
                time to time in order to use the Services. SwiftGuard also retains the right to create limits and
                restrictions on the use of the Services and/or Content or suspend or terminate your access to the
                Services and/or Content, at SwiftGuard’s sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                From time to time, we may make changes to these Terms. They will be effective upon posting notice of
                such changes on the SwiftGuard website (swiftguard.app) (the “Website”) and/or within the App. The most
                current version of the Terms is available on the Website and will be effective as of the “Effective
                Date” listed therein. If you do not agree to any change(s), you should stop using the Services.
                Otherwise, your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance and acknowledgment of such
                change(s).
            </p>
            <h3>C. Service Features and SwiftGuard Advertisements</h3>
            <p>
                To use the Services and access the Content most effectively, you must enable your mobile device as
                follows: to receive push notifications from the App; to permit the App to access both the camera and
                microphone for your device (in some cases, to access additional functionality); and to permit the App to
                access your location (even in the background; i.e., when the App is not open on your device). (For
                example, the Services are designed to deliver push notifications to users within a certain radius of a
                reported incident.) If you do not enable your mobile device accordingly (including enabling any
                additional features or functions that SwiftGuard elects to make mandatory for use of the App), the App
                will not function effectively on your device and you will not be able to access all the functionality
                available from the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                You must provide all equipment and operating platforms as may be necessary to connect to the Service and
                access the Content, including, but not limited to, a mobile device that is suitable to connect with and
                use the App. You are solely responsible for any fees, including internet connection or mobile fees, that
                you incur when accessing the Services and Content.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Services and Content may include advertisements for SwiftGuard’s own products and services. These
                advertisements may be targeted to the Content, your location, your use of the Services, information
                regarding the Services, queries made through the Services, or other information that you have provided.
                You agree that SwiftGuard may place such advertisements on the Services, and you acknowledge that the
                placement of such advertisements may change from time to time.
            </p>
            <h3>D. SwiftGuard Communications</h3>
            <p>
                By creating an account or using the Services, you consent to receive communications from SwiftGuard and
                acknowledge that such communications may be in the form of emails, text messages, or other forms of
                communications. You agree that all notices, disclosures, and other communications that we send you
                electronically will satisfy any legal requirements, including that such communications be in writing.
            </p>
            <h3>E. Account Security</h3>
            <p>
                You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information, including your
                password, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to
                immediately notify SwiftGuard of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security.
                SwiftGuard will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this
                section.
            </p>
            <h2>5. APP STORE AND GOOGLE PLAY STORE APPLICATIONS</h2>
            <p>
                With respect to any App accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (an “App Store Sourced
                Application”), you will only use such App Store Sourced Application (a) on an Apple-branded product that
                runs iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system); and (b) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in
                the Apple App Store Terms of Service. Notwithstanding the first sentence in this section, with respect
                to any App accessed through or downloaded from the Google Play Store (a “Google Play Sourced
                Application”), you may have additional license rights with respect to the use of such Google Play
                Sourced Application on a shared basis within your designated family group.
            </p>

            <h2>6. SWIFTGUARD RIGHTS</h2>
            <p>
                All right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will
                remain the exclusive property of SwiftGuard and its licensors. The Services are protected by copyright,
                trademark, and other laws of both Sweden, Zambia, and foreign countries. SwiftGuard reserves all rights
                not expressly granted in these Terms. You acknowledge and agree that any feedback, comments, Content, or
                suggestions you may provide regarding SwiftGuard or the Services is entirely voluntary, and that we will
                be free to use such feedback, comments, Content, or suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation
                to you, even after you cease using or participating in the Services.
            </p>

            <h2>7. PREMIUM SERVICES FEES AND AUTO RENEWAL TERMS</h2>
            <h3>A. Premium Services Subscription Fees</h3>
            <p>
                You will be responsible for payment of the applicable fee for any Premium Services (each, a “Service
                Subscription Fee”) at the time you register for the Premium Services and select your monthly or annual
                subscription, as may be available (each, a “Service Commencement Date”). Except as set forth in these
                Terms, all Service Subscription Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable. No contract will exist
                between you and SwiftGuard for the Premium Services until SwiftGuard or the third-party app store from
                whom you received the App license (e.g., the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store) (each, an “App
                Store”) accepts your order by a confirmatory email, SMS/MMS message, or other appropriate means of
                communication. Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to the Premium Services, if
                expressly provided to you, is only effective for the specified time of the trial. At the end of the
                trial period, your use and access to that Premium Service will expire, and any further use of the
                Premium Service is prohibited unless you pay the applicable Service Subscription Fees.
            </p>

            <h3>B. Automatic Renewal for Premium Services</h3>
            <p>
                Your subscription to any Premium Services will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with
                these Terms. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period,
                your subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each a
                “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at SwiftGuard’s
                then-current Service Subscription Fee for such Premium Service. You agree that your account will be
                subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at least 24 hours prior to
                the Renewal Commencement Date pursuant to Section 8(A) below. If you cancel your subscription, you may
                use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not
                be renewed after that current term expires. You can cancel your subscription in the App under the App
                Settings section. However, you will not be eligible for any refund of any portion of the Service
                Subscription Fee paid (pro-rata or otherwise) for the then-current subscription period. By subscribing
                to a Premium Service, you authorize SwiftGuard, its payment processor, or the applicable App Store to
                charge your Payment Provider (as defined in Section 7(C) below) at the time you first purchase your
                subscription, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your
                subscription, if SwiftGuard, its payment processor, or the applicable App Store does not receive payment
                from your Payment Provider, (1) you agree to pay all amounts due on your account for the full
                subscription period upon demand; and/or (2) you agree that SwiftGuard may either terminate or suspend
                your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Provider until payment is received.
            </p>

            <h3>C. Payment</h3>
            <p>
                You agree to pay all Service Subscription Fees in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms
                in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. You must provide or have provided SwiftGuard,
                its payment processor, or the App Store from which you purchase the Premium Service with a valid credit
                card (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us or them) (“Payment Provider”) as a condition
                to signing up for the Premium Service. Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the
                designated credit card, and you must refer to that agreement, not these Terms, to determine your rights
                and liabilities with respect to your use of your card. You agree that SwiftGuard, its payment processor,
                or the App Store from which you purchase the Premium Service is authorized to immediately invoice your
                account for all fees and charges due and payable to SwiftGuard hereunder and that no additional notice
                or consent is required. SwiftGuard reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing
                methods, either immediately upon posting on the Website or the App, as communicated via the Services, or
                by email delivery to you.
            </p>

            <h3>D. Taxes</h3>
            <p>
                The payments required under Section 7(A) (Premium Services Subscription Fees) of these Terms do not
                include any Sales Tax that may be due in connection with the services provided under these Terms. If
                SwiftGuard determines it has a legal obligation to collect a Sales Tax from you in connection with these
                Terms, SwiftGuard shall collect such Sales Tax in addition to the payments required under Section 7(A)
                (Premium Services Subscription Fees) of these Terms. If any services, or payments for any services,
                under these Terms are subject to any Sales Tax in any jurisdiction, and you have not remitted the
                applicable Sales Tax to SwiftGuard, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any
                related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify SwiftGuard for any
                liability or expense SwiftGuard may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon SwiftGuard’s
                request, you will provide it with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other
                such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall
                mean any sales or use tax and any other tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent
                of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.
                You agree to make all payments of Service Subscription Fees to SwiftGuard free and clear of, and without
                reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such taxes imposed on payments Service Subscription Fees or
                other charges to SwiftGuard will be your sole responsibility, and you will provide SwiftGuard with
                official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence as we may
                reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid.
            </p>

            <h2>8. SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION</h2>
            <p>
                The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or SwiftGuard as set forth below. If
                SwiftGuard suspends your access to the Services, you agree that SwiftGuard shall have no liability or
                responsibility to you, and SwiftGuard will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the
                fullest extent permitted under applicable law. Nothing in this section shall affect SwiftGuard’s rights
                to change, limit, or stop the provision of the Services without prior notice, as provided herein.
            </p>

            <h3>A. Termination of Services by You</h3>
            <p>
                You may end your legal agreement with SwiftGuard at any time for any reason by deactivating your
                accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services. To deactivate your account, please do so by going
                to “App Settings” in the App or by contacting us via the support center within the Services or at
                swiftguard.app/#contact.
                If you want to terminate the Premium Services provided by SwiftGuard, you may do so by contacting us via
                the support center within the Services or by managing your subscriptions in the applicable App Store. At
                this time, you may do so by (i) logging into and going to the “Manage App Subscriptions” page in the
                Apple App Store or the “My Apps” page in the Google Play Store app or (ii) visiting the SwiftGuard
                website, but we may change this subscription management process in the future. The subscription
                management functions in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store may permit you to change your account
                settings if you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically or if you want to change or cancel
                your subscription. The Services will continue, and you will continue to be charged the Service
                Subscription Fee, at the end of each subscription period unless you cancel your subscription in
                accordance with the procedure set forth in Section 7(B) above (Automatic Renewal for Premium Services).
            </p>

            <h3>B. Suspension or Termination of Services by SwiftGuard</h3>
            <p>
                We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any
                time for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (1) you have violated
                these Terms or any applicable law, rule, or regulation; (2) your actions may cause legal liability for
                you, other users, or SwiftGuard; or (3) the provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially
                viable.
                We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email associated with your account or through the
                Services, but SwiftGuard is not obligated to provide such notice, and we may limit or restrict your
                access to the Services without notice.
            </p>

            <h3>C. Effect of Termination</h3>
            <p>
                Upon termination of these Terms, your account will be disabled, and you may lose access to the Services,
                including all Content in your account. Your obligations under these Terms will survive termination,
                including your obligation to pay any fees owed to SwiftGuard.
            </p>
            <h2>E. Premium Services Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>In addition to and not in lieu of the above disclaimers and limitations in the sections above, please be
                advised of the following important disclaimers and limitations associated with the Premium Services.</p>

            <h3>i. 911 Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>We cannot guarantee that the Premium Services will be able to connect you to 911 or other emergency
                services or to maintain a connection once established. Please call 911 directly using your mobile device
                or phone if there is any problem or delay. The Premium Services or specific elements of such Services
                (including provision of location information) may be unavailable for any number of reasons, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Congestion or other network failures between your mobile device and our facilities;</li>
                <li>Faults in your mobile device;</li>
                <li>Problems with connectivity or operation, including issues with clarity, audio recognition, or
                    geolocation;</li>
                <li>Unavailability of our facilities;</li>
                <li>If a SwiftGuard Agent (who provides response and coordination to Response Incidents) is not
                    available when you attempt to use the Premium Services;</li>
                <li>If your line or access to the government’s 911 call center is disabled, interrupted, or delayed,
                    including if 911 service is unavailable due to problems at the government’s call center; or</li>
                <li>For other reasons beyond our control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>ii. Medical or Expert Advice Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>NEITHER SWIFTGUARD NOR ITS SWIFTGUARD AGENTS ARE AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE MEDICAL OR EXPERT ADVICE OR
                DIAGNOSIS, AND THE PREMIUM SERVICES ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR THAT PURPOSE OR INTENDED TO BE USED FOR THAT
                PURPOSE. USE OF THE PREMIUM SERVICES DOES NOT CREATE A PHYSICIAN-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP OR ANY OTHER KIND
                OF PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING TREATMENT FROM EMERGENCY
                RESPONDERS OR A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL OR OTHER EXPERTS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO SEE YOUR DOCTOR OR A PHYSICIAN
                IF YOU WISH TO MAKE ANY DECISION ABOUT YOUR HEALTH OR THE HEALTH OF YOUR FAMILY. YOU MUST INDEPENDENTLY
                EVALUATE ANY ADVICE YOU MAY RECEIVE FROM SWIFTGUARD AGENTS OR RESPONDERS, INCLUDING THE 911 OPERATOR OR
                OTHER SERVICE PROVIDER THAT THE SWIFTGUARD AGENT MAY CONNECT YOU WITH. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE
                PERFORMANCE OF ANY 911 OPERATOR, SERVICE PROVIDER, OR RESPONDER THAT MAY ARRIVE AS A RESULT OF THE
                PREMIUM SERVICES.</p>

            <h3>iii. Connectivity & Locational Limitations</h3>
            <p>Due to the potential for service interruptions, outages, or poor connections on phone lines, internet
                service providers, mobile carriers, or other communication systems, none of which are within the control
                of SwiftGuard, your connection to the Premium Services is not guaranteed. Similarly, SwiftGuard will
                have no liability to you if your mobile device is out of the service area of the network provider.
                SwiftGuard is not responsible for, and shall have no liability with respect to, service interruptions,
                outages, or failures of a customer’s telephone, mobile, or data service. SwiftGuard is not responsible
                if emergency responders are unable to locate you, whether because you have not enabled the GPS
                functionality of or location services on your mobile device, or there is a failure, error, or lack of
                specificity in transmission of GPS information, or otherwise.</p>

                reliance on the Content or Services; (b) your conduct with respect to any other users, including in
                connection with any public incidents on the Services; (c) your Content; or (d) your violation of these
                Terms.</p>

            <h2>12. RELEASE</h2>
            <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU HEREBY RELEASE THE SWIFTGUARD ENTITIES FROM ANY
                AND ALL LIABILITY, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, ACTIONS, AND CAUSES OF ACTION, WHATSOEVER, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED

                1542 or any similar provision of the statutory or non-statutory law of any other jurisdiction
                (including, without limitation, Missouri, Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, Montana, Oklahoma, Wisconsin,
                and Pennsylvania) to the full extent that you may lawfully waive all such rights and benefits. You
                acknowledge that the releases in these Terms are intended to be as broad and inclusive as permitted by
                law, and as a complete and continuous release and waiver of liability for any and all use of the
                Services.</p>
